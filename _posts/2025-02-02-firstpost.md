# First Kaggle Competition
After graduating from Purdue University with a degree in Data Science, I realized that my portfolio lacked projects beyond the classroom. To address this, I decided to embark on a solo project to put my knowledge into practice. I aimed to apply what I had learned in a practical setting, focusing on model creation rather than a data engineering-focused task.

## Project Overview
For this project, I chose a dataset from Kaggle's Playground Series ([Competition Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e2/overview)). This competition involves predicting the price of backpacks based on various attributes. The dataset includes multiple features describing different characteristics of the backpacks, and our goal is to develop a model that accurately estimates their prices.

## Data Exploration
For the data exploration phase of this project, I decided to start with a smaller subset of the data that was provided in a separate file. This subset consisted of 300,000 rows, representing approximately 7.5% of the entire training dataset. I believed this smaller sample was a good starting point for conducting a preliminary analysis and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the features and target variable.

The first step involved loading the data into a pandas DataFrame. Once the data was loaded, I visualized the distributions of all the columns. This involved plotting histograms for numerical variables and bar charts for categorical variables. The visualizations revealed that most columns were evenly distributed across categories for categorical variables and spanned a range for numeric variables.

Following the initial exploration, I examined a correlation matrix for the numerical variables. This matrix helped identify the relationships between the features and the target variable. However, the correlation matrix indicated that there were no particularly strong correlations worth noting between the numeric features and the target variable.
